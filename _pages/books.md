Books were my first love. I read actively and urgently, rocking between _Hardy Boys_ and _The Dark is Rising_ in my mom's embroidery-backed chair. I wrote basic fantasy inspired by _The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Golden Compass_. I re-read _Harry Potter_ six times during my sister's horse shows, mourned the bigotry of its author. I reawakened during high school with _100 Years of Solitude_ and _Our Town_, an invitation to magical realism and Southern Gothic fiction that I'd later find in Ishiguro, Pynchon, Munro, and Faulkner. I cited three quotes in my PhD thesis:

“It is my life, I have found it out, and cannot part with it.”

– George Eliot, Middlemarch

“Quite frankly, I don’t know what’s to be done. But you might at least be curious.”

– Kazuo Ishiguro, The Remains of the Day

“This spiritualist, this statistician, what are you anyway?”

– Thomas Pynchon, Gravity’s Rainbow

I'll try to list the books I'm reading/have read since 2025, while highlighting my very favorites with reviews on why I think they should be read. Thanks for indulging me!

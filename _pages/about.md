Hey! Thanks for dropping by. I'm Joey. I have a B.S. and Ph.D. in Chemical and Biological Engineering, the latter of which I completed under the advisement of Dr. Nanette R. Boyle at Colorado School of Mines. We used agent-based modeling and flux balance analysis (code acting like individuals + figuring out the fastest route to grow in metabolism) to interrogate _Trichodesmium erythraeum_'s colony forming behavior and capacity to fix nitrogen and $CO_2$ simultaneously during the day. Since then, I've been involved in engineering to optimize nitrogen fixation for industrial ag, finding drug targets for autoimmune disorders using metabolism-centric approaches, untargeted metabolomics, microbiome research, and software for science research. In my other life, I'm trying to build a non-profit to provide fresh produce for at-risk communities in Boston in a way that actually saves the city money. I'm a hit at parties.

I write because I like to. I write also because I'm opinionated on the following categories, each with different levels of trustworthy experience from high to low:

## I'm pretty good at this

- Software-assisted biological research,
- Techniques dealing with large data,
- Telling data stories,
- Metabolism, metabolomics, and multiomics,
- Networks, and why they're more informative than tabular outputs,
- What makes literary fiction effective,
- How to be outdoors.

## I know my way around

- AI and LLM strategies for accelerating R&D (dos and don'ts),
- Creating data-intensive applications that actually mean something
- Management and mentorship in startups,
- Food equity in urban environments.

## So far, so good

- Creating robust and successful non-profits that actively address a community issue,
- DIY for internal design and avoiding losing fingers,
- DnD, board games, and creating.

I'll write about these and post pictures of my dog, Ducky. The effort is to digest some of the biggest problems we face:

- What do we do with all this junk, all this junk inside our trunks? (These noisy biological data that don't perform well for us),
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (How do we feed people consistently throughout the week, especially those without cars or economics to support buying from traditional American grocery stores)
- I'ma be doin' my thing (DIY, books, art, outdoors)
